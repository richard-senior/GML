# GML

GCode Markup Language

***This code is provided to you without any form of warrenty or support.
It is assumed that you are a programmer who will know how to modify this code to suit your own ends.***

The intention is to eventually create something a little like [Linux CNC](http://linuxcnc.org/) for use
with inexpensive low end (hobbyist) CNC engraving, drawing, and laser cutting machines.

Currently the main functionality provided can already be achieved using Inkscape and the GCodeTools extension
(see below). But having to return to Inkscape, modify and re-export constantly just to make small modifications
can be cumbersome. This project allows modifications to GCode directly without having to use Inkscape etc.

So for example you may find that the GCode exported from GCodeTools is correct but that you wish to 
temporarily move the whole engraving 1mm to the right, or to rotate it all by 10 degrees (to fit the
blank material you currently have etc.)

Or you may wish for the machine to return to zero after every path cut (so you can trial something) etc.

Intended future functionality includes:
* Full lexical parsing (python PLY lex/yacc) of GCode (plus bespoke extensions) syntax
* Import directly from SVG (no need for GCodeTools export) and export to SVG (for quick visualisation)
* Contributing (or doing something similar) to GCodeTools (adding another set of post processing methods?)
* more manipulation functions including : 
  * auto path fill using cross hatch or path dilation (the eggbot tools are unreliable)
  * Auto tool diameter change refactoring
  * ..
  

## Current Funtionality
* Parses output (.nc) from the [Inkscape GCodeTools extension](https://github.com/cnc-club/gcodetools)
  Breaks the code into 'blocks' based upon various hueristics (z axis up/down, G00 codes, M5 etc.)
  Allows manipulation of code or blocks of code (extrude, translate, rotate, reverse more to come)
  Auto adds standard headers (start spindle etc.) and footers (return to x0,y0,z0 ready for next pass)
* Parses output from the [Python svg-to-gcode library](https://pypi.org/project/svg-to-gcode/)
  Blockifies it (as with GCodeTools) and provides the same manipulation functionality.
  
## Usage

Begin by drawing the paths to engrave in Inkscape and using the GCodeTools plugin to export
the paths to a .nc file.
You can find many videos on YouTube to demonstrate this by searching simply for "Inkscape GCodeTools".

Create a python file and write code such as:
```python
# import the main class of this tool set
import GrblCommand.GrblCommand

# set some constants which are static member variables of the class
# these constants will allow you to achieve certain routine tasks
GrblCommand.fast_travel_speed = 800
GrblCommand.evacuation_height = 1
GrblCommand.cut_speed = 80
GrblCommand.autoBlockSort = True

# process the nc file exported from Inkscape
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("/temp/raw.nc","/temp/processed.nc")
# You may use the response (foo) to continue working on the GCode if desired, or just ignore it.
# for example
foo = foo.rotateBlock(90, 100, 100, 3)
foo.burp("/temp/rotated_block.nc")
```

## Example

Begin by creating a path in Inkscape etc. (an SVG) ie:

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/a.svg?raw=true)

You can actually directly import this using (GrblCommand.processSvg(in,out)) but I'll properly document that later
when the functionality is imporoved

use GCodeTools to export this to GCode which gives something like:

```
(Header)
(Generated by gcodetools from Inkscape.)
(Using default header. To add your own header create file "header" in the output dir.)
M3
(Header end.)
G21 (All units in mm)

(Pass at depth -1.0)
(Start cutting path id: path12970-7)
(Change tool to Default tool)

(End cutting path id: path12970-7)

```

Use a tool like [nc viewer](https://ncviewer.com/) to check the GCode (looks like this):
Note that in future hopefully you will be able to directly export to SVG rather than use NC Viewer etc.

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/ghpic.png?raw=true)

Now we can use GrblCommand to modify the GCode directly.

### Rotate
So perhaps we want to rotate the letter (to fit the blank material better etc.):

```
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("a.nc","a_.nc")
# rotate 45 degrees about the x=0 y=0 coordinate
foo = foo.rotate(45, 0, 0)
foo.burp(outfile)
```

Check the output in [nc viewer](https://ncviewer.com/) gives:

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/arot.png?raw=true)

### translate

Maybe you need to just move the letter right?

```
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("a.nc","a_.nc")
# move the letter right by 10 units (mm) (negative for left/up)
foo = foo.translate(10,0)
foo.burp(outfile)
```

Gives:

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/tran.png?raw=true)

### extrude
Perhaps you wish to iteratively deepen the path?

```
#each iteration will be 0.2mm deeper than the last
GrblCommand.depth_step = -0.2
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("a.nc","a_.nc")
# make three passes, the True ('by block' param is used when there are multiple blocks in the source file)
foo = foo.extrude(3, True)
foo.burp(outfile)
```

Gives:

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/ext.png?raw=true)

### scale
Scaling is done by multiplying each x,y coordinate by the scale factor and
recalculating arcs etc. In this respect it is very much like a 'dilate' with the
centre of dilation being 0,0.
If you wish to just globally increase or decrease the size of the whole GRBL file
this is probably the best method.

```
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("a.nc","a_.nc")
# Scales the entire file by a factor of n (so 2 would be twice as big, 0.5 would be twice as small)
foo = foo.scale(0.5)
foo.burp(outfile)
```

Gives:

![alt text](https://github.com/richard-senior/GML/blob/main/scale.png?raw=true)


### chaining functions

You can perform multiple operations as follows:

```
foo = GrblCommand.processGrbl("a.nc","a_.nc")
foo = foo.rotate(45, 0, 0)
foo = foo.translate(10,0)
foo.burp(outfile)
```

Which would rotate and then move the whole grbl file


### future
Hopefully I'll provide:
```
# Iteratively fill any closed path by dilating inwards with each iteration being 2mm smaller
# until it is not possible to create another dilation
# That is: 'fill the path' by dilating.
GrblCommand.dilate(-2)

# Hatch fill any closed path assuming a tool diameter of 1mm
GrblCommand.hatch(1)
```

etc.

## contributing
I realise this code is a mess. I literally hacked it together to perform a task I needed doing at the time.
I want to begin refactoring this to use PLY for the parsing of the GCODE import, perhaps use Lexx to break
the code into blocks based on various hueristics, rather than by postprocessing LexToken's manually.
If you wish to help or offer feature suggestions, please let me know.
